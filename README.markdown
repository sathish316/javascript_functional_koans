# Javascript Functional Koans - Functional Programming for the Rest of Us#

This is inspired by Edgecase's [Ruby
koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans) and the suite is
forked from [Javascript koans](https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans)

The goal of Javascript functional koans is to teach basic functional
programming concepts using Javascript.

It is based on the following articles:
1. [Functional Programming for the Rest of Us](http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html).
2. [Best introductions to Monad i've ever read (Haskell to Javascript)](http://blog.jcoglan.com/2011/03/05/translation-from-haskell-to-javascript-of-selected-portions-of-the-best-introduction-to-monads-ive-ever-read/)

It uses the koans philosophy to teach the following concepts:

1. Functions as First class objects
2. Recursion
3. Higher order functions
4. Currying
5. Lazy evaluation
6. Continuations
7. Pattern matching
8. Closures
9. Monads

The koans will stick to the original article.
